First, I’d like to thank [HostMyServers](https://www.hostmyservers.fr/) for providing me a server to host DuckHunt on. It is fast, reliable and well-supported!

Adding the official bot to your server is super easy ! Follow the instructions:

*   Join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/2BksEkV) to get support if needed. You can ask a @Moderator to get the @Server Owner role, reserved for admins of DuckHunt on their servers!
*   **Invite the bot to your server by clicking** [**here**](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=187636051135823872&permissions=70646849&scope=bot)
*   In the channel you want to use, type !setup and follow the instructions given to you.

Thanks for using DuckHunt!
